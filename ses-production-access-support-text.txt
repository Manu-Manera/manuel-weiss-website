Subject: Request for SES Production Access - EU (Frankfurt) Region

Hello AWS Support Team,

I would like to request production access for Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) in the EU (Frankfurt) / eu-central-1 region.

Service: Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)
Region: EU (Frankfurt) / eu-central-1
Limit Type: SES Sending Limits
Limit: SES Production Access
New Limit Value: 1

Use Case Description:
I am using AWS Cognito for user authentication in my web application. When users register on my website (https://mawps.netlify.app), they need to receive email verification codes to confirm their email addresses and activate their accounts.

This is a standard transactional email use case for user account verification. The emails are:
- Transactional in nature (verification codes, not marketing)
- Sent only when users explicitly register
- Required for the core functionality of the application

Website URL: https://mawps.netlify.app
Mail Type: Transactional
Expected Sending Volume: Low (< 1000 emails per day)

I understand and will comply with AWS SES policies and best practices, including:
- Proper handling of bounces and complaints
- Maintaining good email sending practices
- Not sending unsolicited emails

Currently, my SES account is in sandbox mode, which prevents me from sending verification emails to new users who register. This blocks the core functionality of my application.

I would appreciate your approval for production access so that I can send verification emails to all users who register on my website.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
